The book is not a conventional autobiography or a chronological memoir. Rather, it is a series of personal and critical insights into the people and events that shaped Serbian culture in the turbulent times of wars, revolutions, and social changes. Mihiz writes with wit, irony, and candor, revealing both the strengths and weaknesses of his subjects, as well as his own opinions and judgments. He also offers anecdotes, anecdotes that illustrate the human side of the literary giants and their relationships with each other.

Autobiografija - o drugima is a valuable source of information and inspiration for anyone interested in Serbian literature and history. It is also a testament to Mihiz's erudition, style, and passion for writing. As Vladan BajÄeta writes in his afterword to the book[^2^], "Autobiografija - o drugima is a sure guide for new generations of readers and writers: it casts a strong light on the past, as well as on the future, confirming the well-known thought of MiloÅ¡ Crnjanski that memoirs have always been the best part of literature, especially when they are not literally faithful."[^3^]
  
Mihiz was not only a writer and a critic, but also a dramatist and a screenwriter. He wrote several original plays, such as BanoviÄ Strahinja, Komandant Sajler, KraljeviÄ Marko, and OptuÅ¾eni Pera TodoroviÄ, as well as adaptations of famous literary works, such as Autobiografija by Branislav NuÅ¡iÄ, Korespondencija by Borislav PekiÄ, Ranjeni orao by Mir Jam, DerviÅ¡ i smrt by MeÅ¡a SelimoviÄ, and Orlovi rano lete by Branko ÄopiÄ. His plays and adaptations were performed in various theaters in Belgrade and other cities in Yugoslavia. He also collaborated with Mira TrailoviÄ in creating the theater Atelje 212 and was its artistic adviser from 1971 to 1983[^3^].
 
As a screenwriter, Mihiz worked on several films and TV series, such as Put oko sveta, Dve noÄi u jednom danu, Branko RadiÄeviÄ, Roj, Silom otac, and others. He also wrote scripts for documentaries and animated films. He was awarded with several prizes for his dramatic and cinematic work, such as the Sterija Award, the Marin DrÅ¾iÄ Award, and the ÄorÄe JovanoviÄ Award.
 
Mihiz was also a prominent figure in the cultural and political life of Yugoslavia. He was one of the leaders of the Committee for the Protection of Artistic Freedom, which defended the rights of writers and artists against censorship and repression. He was also a friend and supporter of Milovan Äilas, a dissident politician and writer who criticized the communist regime. Mihiz himself faced difficulties and obstacles because of his views and associations. He was often marginalized or dismissed from his positions. He was also banned from publishing his works for several years in the 1980s[^2^].
