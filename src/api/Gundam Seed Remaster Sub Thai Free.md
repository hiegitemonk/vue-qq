If you are wondering what Gundam Seed Remaster is about, here is a brief summary of the plot:
 
The year is Cosmic Era 71. The Earth Alliance and the ZAFT forces are engaged in a bloody war that has lasted for almost a year. The Earth Alliance is composed of natural humans who live on Earth, while the ZAFT forces are composed of Coordinators, genetically enhanced humans who live in space colonies called PLANTs. The war started when the ZAFT forces attacked a neutral space colony called Heliopolis, where the Earth Alliance was secretly developing five advanced mobile suits called Gundams. During the attack, four of the Gundams were stolen by ZAFT, while the fifth one, the Strike Gundam, was activated by Kira Yamato, a young Coordinator who was living in Heliopolis. Kira escaped with the Strike Gundam and joined the Archangel, an Earth Alliance ship that was also stationed in Heliopolis. Along with his friends and allies, Kira fought against the ZAFT forces, which included his childhood friend Athrun Zala, who was one of the pilots of the stolen Gundams. As the war continued, Kira and Athrun faced many challenges and conflicts, both on and off the battlefield. They also encountered other characters who had their own roles and motivations in the war, such as Lacus Clyne, a popular singer and daughter of a PLANT leader; Cagalli Yula Athha, a rebellious princess of a neutral nation; Rau Le Creuset, a mysterious ZAFT commander; and Mu La Flaga, a charismatic Earth Alliance pilot.
